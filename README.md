# legacy-flix-chat

This is a legacy project, created as a POC using ReactJS and [ChatKit](https://pusher.com/chatkit). 
Users are able to log in to the application and share messages in real-time.

To start the app:

    git clone git@github.com:krynv/legacy-flix-chat.git
    npm i
    npm start

This launches the server on port `1337` - unless specified otherwise in a commandline parameter, and client on port `3000`.
